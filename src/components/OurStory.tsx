          Since 2015, Urbanika has been experimenting with urban commons, cooperatives,
          participatory budgets, co-production of public services, and upskilling citizens in
          circular economy, technology, and peer governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with local authorities, researchers, neighbors, and businesses to co-design,
          produce, and deliver the solutions needed to improve city-living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team has been evolving, but has always been formed by activists, scientists,
          and professionals that live and breath urban regeneration.
